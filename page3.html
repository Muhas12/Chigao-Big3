    <p>Dennis Rodman, in full Dennis Keith Rodman, byname the Worm, (born May 13, 1961, Trenton, New Jersey, U.S.), American professional basketball player who was one of the most skilled rebounders, best defenders, and most outrageous characters in the history of the professional game. He was a key part of two National Basketball Association (NBA) championship teams with the Detroit Pistons (1989–90) and three with the Chicago Bulls (1996–98) and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011.

<p>Rodman, who was 5 feet 11 inches (1.75 metres) tall when he graduated from high school in Dallas and who tried and failed to make the school basketball team four times, shot up more than another 7 inches (18 cm) and earned a spot on the Cooke County Junior College team in Dallas in 1981. A scholarship to play at Southeastern Oklahoma State University followed. Proving himself to be a prodigious collegiate rebounder, he was drafted in 1986 by the Pistons and was pivotal to the success of Detroit’s “Bad Boys” championship teams.
